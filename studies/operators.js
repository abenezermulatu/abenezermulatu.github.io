/*
Operators:
*
* Operators havae the job of may operations: assignment(=), pefroming arithmetic(=,-,*,**,/,%,++,--), 
comparison(==,===,!=,!==,>,<,>=,<=,?), use logical(&&,||,!), use unary(!, typeOf, -), 
and Ternary (a ? b : c) 
*
*
* 1) Assignment operators(=): assign the value to a variable
*(var x = 10;)
*
* 2) Arithmetic operators(=,-,*,**,/,%,++,--): math used to print or return numerical answers
*(var x = 3;
x += 5 )
*
* 3) comparison operators(==,===,!=,!==,>,<,>=,<=,?): takes two agruments and test them by 
comparing the two values
*(23 < 22)
*
* 4) logical operators(&&,||,!): used in if statments, to check if both statments are true 
or false(&&), if we want to check either statment to be true or false we use (||) 
and if we want to the opposite value to return or print we ues a not equal to operator(!);
*(23 < 22 && 3 > 2)
*
* 5) unary operators(!, typeOf, -, delete): job is to get oen item to return, the one item is 
a string, variable, keyword, or object (aka operand). sometimes we may need to manipulate the code to use an unary operator.
*(typeof null) returns 'object' as used in scatch pad.
*
* 6) Ternary operator (a ? b : c) known as the conditional operator bc its job is to check if true, 
return "1", if false reutrn the next thing "2".
* var burbonStreetEntry;
var ageLimit = (age > 21) ? "Welcome":"Goodbye";
