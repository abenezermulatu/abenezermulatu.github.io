/*
 * String manipulation:
 *
 * 
 * JavaScript has implemented methods that are intended to change strings some examples are (.toUpperCase, .toLowerCase, .split())
 *  
 *

//  1. With opertors: these are already in javascript, for example .split() splits a string and returns an array of strings

// 2. With methods: This helps finding and returning, for example indexof() gives us the index position.
